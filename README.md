## Description

The Contact Keeper App is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that allows users to manage their contacts efficiently. This project originated as a part of Brad Traversy's React Front to Back Course on Udemy and has been refactored to use React Router Version 6 and modern hooks for state management. The application utilizes JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the app's features.

To experience the app, you can log in using the following credentials:
- **Email:** alicejohnson@example.com
- **Password:** 123456

The app features comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, empowering users to effectively manage their contact list. The user interface is built using React.js and is enhanced with basic animations created using the Framer Motion library.

## Features
